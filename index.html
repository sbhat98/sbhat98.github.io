<ul>
<li>Each room is a property.  Everyone will receive a piece and 10,000 “dollars”.  The PL rooms are safe spaces where you collect 150 dollars for landing on or passing.
There will be a miniature board in the lounge to show the floor’s layout and showcase the instructions and rules.</li>

<li>When you land on a property that hasn’t been purchased yet you can purchase it for the amount listed below or you can not purchase it.  If you land on a property that has been purchased than you’re “eating”  there and have to pay according to the color and how expensive the property is.</li>

<li>Once you’ve purchased a restaurant you can purchase upgrades outdoor seating (like the house in monopoly) and a michelin star ranked chef (like the hotels in monopoly).  These must be purchased before you move for the day and you can only buy one upgrade per day.</li>

<li>The outdoor seating ranges in price depending on the property value. The michelin star ranked chef ranges in price depending on the property value.


<ul>
<li>You cannot purchase outdoor seating or a chef for your property until a turn has passed (you must wait a day).  Additionally, you can only purchase one deck/chef a day.</li></ul>
</li>

<li>If you find yourself in need of some cash you can sell your decks and chefs for half of what you bought them for and you can mortgage your house and receive the amount listed below in the chart. If you mortgage your property you will not recieve money when peeps land on it just FYI.</li>
